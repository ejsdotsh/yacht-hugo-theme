**YACHT** **A**nother **C**ustom **H**ugo **T**heme*

when graduating from highschool, i was voted *"most likely to own a yacht"* by my senior class. i don't think this is what they meant...

***YACHT*** is a punny and recursively named theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator which uses the [Catppuccin Palettes](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/blob/main/docs/style-guide.md) for color, and aims to be simple, mobile-first, accessible, responsive, and to have minimal external dependencies.
